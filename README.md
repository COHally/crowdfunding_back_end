## Planning:

### Concept/Name
A crowdfunding model for immigrants in Australia. 
### Intended Audience/User Stories
My intended audience are immigrants living in Australia who will utilise the site to raise funds to allow them to return to their home country for various reasons - sick family members etc. The idea is that different communities will support each other. 

### Front End Pages/Functionality
- {{ A page on the front end }}
- {{ A list of dot-points showing functionality is available on this page }}
- {{ etc }}
- {{ etc }}
- {{ A second page available on the front end }}
- {{ Another list of dot-points showing functionality }}
- {{ etc }}

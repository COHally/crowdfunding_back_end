# Crowdfunding Back End
{{ Cathy O Halloran}}
## Planning: 
### Concept/Name
{{ My website is called Ceili. Ceili is an Irish word that describes a social gathering or dance. They are a community event that brings people together. The concept for my website is a crowdfunding website that is geared towards immigrants in Australia. It would allow users to crowdfund to allow them to visit their home country for various reasons like visiting a sick family member with the support of other immigrants.}}
### Intended Audience/User Stories
{{ My intended audience is the immigrant community living in Australia. They will use the website to fund other immigrants to visit their home country to visit family members. }}
### Front End Pages/Functionality
- {{ A page on the front end }}

- {{ etc }}

### API Spec
{{ Fill out the table below to define your endpoints. An example of what this
might look like is shown at the bottom of the page.
It might look messy here in the PDF, but once it's rendered it looks very neat!
It can be helpful to keep the markdown preview open in VS Code so that you can
see what you're typing more easily. }}
